            She managed to convey to a young knight a ready drink, he got it and drank it. That girl forgot about the important detail - a drink had to be drunk in small quantities.
    
            She did not warn him about it.
    
            Her husband drunk everything until the last drop, and the time for him began to flow much slower, he did not grow up, he did not grow old and stayed for a short time in his charming temporal dimension,
