<p>
        A large, diverse and rich modern game world is very difficult to classify by genre. 
        "Quest" - is one of the varieties of games that is quite popular among young people, and entices all true connoisseurs of adventure.
        The task of all quests is to search for goals. To achieve their goal, players need to be to work with each other, correctly study the information provided, apply dexterity, intelligence and any useful personal skills..<br>

        Our quest is a game on the streets of Lviv.<br>

        Before the quest, participants are divided into teams (6-8 people). Each team chooses his name, and the attendant. The captains of the teams are determined. During the game, each team will receive tasks in envelopes. Each completed task gives you an opportunity to get a hint. Take your time. It is important not to do any mistakes and complete the whole task. You should find the next envelope with the task with the help of a card.<br>

        If you do not make a mistake and do all these tasks, the last tip will lead you to treasure. A team that first performs all tasks and finds the treasure will be the winner.<br>

        But there is another important condition: all members of the team must participate in the tasks. Each team will be assigned a supervisor, who will monitor the performance of the tasks and behaviors of the players. If he sees a violation, the supervisor has the right to fines the team by time. (2 minutes the team will be out of the game)<br>

        Who first performed all the tasks and found the winner the treasure.<br>

        All participants receive certificates of participation in the quest.
